# job-offer-signing
Lightweight enterprise-grade web application for managing job offers and electronic contract signing. Built with Angular 12+ (Tailwind) for the frontend and .NET 6 (C#) for the backend, it enables HR teams to generate offer letters, preview them as PDFs, send them for signature via a simulated DocuSign API, and track signing status in real time.
